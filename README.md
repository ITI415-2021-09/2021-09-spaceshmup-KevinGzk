I main make a boss enemy that will appear when player destroy 10 normal enemys. The boss enemy has 40 health points, and there are two way of shooting bullets at you. I also did some changes in the normal enemy. I make the enemy0, enemy1 move a little bit faster because I find myself only shooting these two enemy to fight the boss because those two are only enemies I can easily hit the target. I slow down the enemy3,4 and decrease their health point because those two enemy move too fast to destroy. And the position where they are spawned can hit player easily.
